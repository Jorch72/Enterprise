# Minecraft: Enterprise Edition mods

Design
======
- Bad things should never happen randomly, only as a result of player mistakes.
- Fun comes from interactions between things. Imagine Minecraft if you could only run one mod at a time.
- Each module should do one thing and do it well.

Modules
======

Ores: Can re-distribute ores to be only in specific ore chunks of their type.

Magma Mining: Drill through bedrock to get magma from below the world, and cool it off into valuable ores. (This keeps ore chunks valuable even if you quarry them - you can pump and cool the magma to get more of that ore.) Naturally, creating what amounts to an artificial volcano can be a bit risky... There's also a prospecting tool, which lets you check what ores might be concentrated nearby.

Disposal: It turns out you can make blades so fine that they'll slice anything apart, even atoms. The liquid that makes can be condensed into blobs of subatomic matter, which when slightly nudged becomes any of a number of useful materials.
